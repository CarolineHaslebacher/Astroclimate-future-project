# Astroclimate-future-project
Impact of climate change on astronomical observations, assessed with high-resolution global climate models from HighResMIP. 

## Description of code structure
All functions are defined in the file 'climxa.py'. The files 'xarray_all_sites_DSCTi_variable.py' generate a plot with subplots of all sites defined in 'sites_lon_lat_dataframe.py' (here: the eight sites evaluated in the study). The subplots contain a timeseries with yearly averages of in situ data (if available), ERA5 data (if I remember correctly, this must be available, if in situ data is not given as an input) and PRIMAVERA data (if model = True).
